I'm a recent graduate in computer science trying to make sense of it all. 
Studying a lot of non-sense.
LISP enthusiast and SICP follower.

To write games isn't about beign an excelent developer, or an exciting game designer or any skill in particular. My current thought of it is beign aware of all possibilities that you have, give all you got, even if is mediocre at each, but produce something unique of that moment in time of yourself. And the longer you keep that journey the best you get not at one individual skill, but with the holistic process of refining your own view of the world. As Rick Rubin put it once: Creating stuff is no different from a diary entry. There is no mistake looking back at it. And there is no way to excel at it. There is only creating.
