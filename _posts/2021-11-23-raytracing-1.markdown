I hope to accomplish with this text a simple endevour that I wanted to write for about a few months:
I want to explain in very simple lines how computer graphics works in simple terms.
There will be some math, but don't worry: I want to make this the most didatical I possibly can. I hope you tag along 
this journey through computer graphics and endup finding yourself amazed by it too.

We going to start with just a single function that put a pixel color in a position of the screen. And from there, I'm going
to explain how we going to "project" tridimensional images onto the screen.
We going to aproach this challenge starting by the most straight forward method first: Raytracing. Which means we going to do exactly
what light does, but, in reverse.
It may sound weird at first, but trust me: it is pretty simple.
So buckle up, and lets get started!
